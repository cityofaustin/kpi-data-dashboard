#### KPI data assessment

## About this repo

This repo has code related to an Open Data Initiative sprint project called KPI Data Assessment. Scope and charter documentation for that project can be found [here](http://open-data-sprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-open-data-plans.html).

In a nutshell, we need to: 

- deploy over 200 surveys to Open Data Liaisons
- collect and process the survey data
- publish a dashboard to track how many surveys are done
- publish the data for everyone to study

So this repo has code to help us do that stuff
